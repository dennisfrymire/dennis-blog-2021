I'm a web developer, transitioning from a previous career in real estate sales and clinical massage therapy. (Yes, two very different fields!) I approach my work with a strong sense of ownership and empathy. 

**Now:**

I am currently in fellowship as a full-stack developer at the [National Democratic Training Committee](https://www.traindemocrats.org).
